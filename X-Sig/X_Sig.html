<h1> X-SIG 2021: Granular Material </h1>
	<h3>Dr. James Puckett, Carlos Sanchez, Han Gong </h3>
<h2> Introduction to&nbsp;Cross-Disciplinary Science Institute at Gettysburg College</h2>
<p>The Cross-Disciplinary Science Institute at Gettysburg College <a href="https://xsigsummer.wordpress.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(X-Sig)</a> was established to help our community of students be research ready, research active and research connected. The X-SIG oversees a set of initiatives designed to equip our students with the skills necessary for modern research, preparing them to integrate multiple disciplines in order to answer scienceâ€™s most pressing questions. </p>

	Granular materials are made up of many microscopic particles. It can range from the sand on the beach to coffee beans in the bag. Although granular material observes the force laws of interactions, it behaves very differently under certain circumstances, they can flow like a liquid, compress like gas, or form a rigid structure like solids. One of the reasons that give the granular material such an interesting characteristic is the friction among all the particles and how they affect the total energy of the state when the particles are in a specific arrangement. Granular material systems also have similar characteristics with traditional molecular glass formers. In the past 30 years, researchers used techniques from statistical mechanics. However, a basic assumption of statistical mechanics is being made for all the past research: equiprobability of states within the granular systems. In our research, we will try to determine if this is a valid assumption or not. By designing and constructing apparatus that can generate new configurations of particles, we can investigate whether microstates are equiprobable. Developing codes and using computer-automated data acquisition. We will analyze the states of each particle and the states of the system by image analysis and photoelastic stress analysis to find the contact forces between particles. We will also investigate what are the factors that give the granular material the ability to exhibit special characteristics in different states. </p>
